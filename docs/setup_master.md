## Master Node Setup
The [Master Node](./terminology.md) includes several services:

* `dashboard`: Provide Web UI for operators.
* `restserver`: Provide RESTful APIs for chain consumers.
* `watchdog`: Watch for health checking.

*More details can be found at the [Architecture Design](./arch.md).*

### System Requirement

* Hardware: 8c16g100g
* Docker engine: 1.10.0~1.13.0 (Docker 17.0+ support is experimental)
* docker-compose: 1.8.0~1.12.0

The [Master Node](./terminology.md) can be deployed by in 2 steps.

* Clone code
* Run setup script

### Clone Code

You may check `git` and `make` are installed to clone the code.

```sh
$ sudo aptitude install git make -y
$ git clone http://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/cello && cd cello
```

### Run Setup

For the first time running, please setup the master node with the [setup.sh](https://github.com/hyperledger/cello/blob/master/scripts/master_node/setup.sh).

Just run (safe to repeat it):

```sh
$ make setup-master
```

Make sure there is no error during the setup. Otherwise, please check the log msgs with `make logs`.

### Usage

#### Start/Stop/Restart
To start the whole services, please run

```sh
$ make start
```

To stop or restart the whole services, run `make stop` or `make restart`.

#### Redeploy a service
To redeploy one specific service, e.g., dashboard, please run

```sh
$ make redeploy service=dashboard
```

#### Check Logs
To check the logs for all the services, please run

```sh
$ make logs
```

To check the logs for one specific service, please run
```sh
$ make log service=watchdog
```

Now you can access the `MASTER_NODE_IP:8080` to open the Web-based [operational dashboard](./dashboard.md).

### Configuration
The application configuration can be imported from file named `CELLO_CONFIG_FILE`.

By default, it also loads the `config.py` file as the configurations.

### Data Storage
The mongo container will use local `/opt/cello/mongo` path (Must exist locally) for persistent storage.

Please keep it safe by backups or using more high-available solutions.

### Work with MacOS

In MacOS, Docker cannot mount local path from host by default. Hence for mongo container data volume, users need to:

* Make sure the `/opt/cello` path exists locally, and it is writable for the current user account. Simply just run `make setup-master`.
* Add the path to `File Sharing` list in the preference of [Docker for MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/), to make it mountable by container.

## Cello Baseimage
![BaseImage](imgs/cello_baseimage.png)

The purpose of this baseimage is to act as a bridge between a raw ubuntu/xenial configuration and the customizations
required for supporting a Hyperledger Cello environment. The build process is generally expensive so it is fairly
inefficient to JIT assemble these components on demand. Hence bundled into baseimage and subsequently cached on
the public repositories, so they can be simply consumed without requiring a local build cycle.

### Usage
* "make docker" will build the docker images and commit it to your local environment; e.g. "hyperledger/cello-baseimage".
The docker image is also tagged with architecture and release details.

### More Commands using make

To know more what the following make commands does please refer [make_support](./make_support.md) page.
